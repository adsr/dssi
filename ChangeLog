20050525 CVS commit smbolton

 * Version bump to 0.9.1.

 * Replaced static makefiles with a full autoconf/automake/libtool
     build system.  Hope it solves more problems than it creates....

 * Dropped message_buffer.[ch] use from less_trivial_synth.c, since
     it's been commented out, and crashes some hosts.

 * Conditionally omit the ALSA sequencer client code from
     jack-dssi-host.c if building on a system without ALSA.

20050516 CVS commit smbolton

Summary of changes, version 0.9 (20041103) through 20050510

 * Fixed less_trivial_synth.c for use on big-endian systems.

 * jack-dssi-host: better handling of LADSPA hinting, support for
     audio inputs, support for LADSPA-only plugins, better signal
     handling with cleaner shutdown, several smaller bug fixes.
