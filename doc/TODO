Stuff remaining to do for the proof of concept:

In the example host:
 * Program change support
 * MIDI program/bank changes mapped to DSSI program changes
 * support for log/samplerate ports
 * GUI discovery [DONE]
 * generic GUI support? nah
 * configure() support, MIDI-over-OSC [latter DONE]
 * maybe NRPNs?
 
In the less trivial synth GUI:
 * configure() / program changes?
 * some sort of MIDI event in / test button? [DONE]
 * what else?
