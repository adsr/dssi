DSSI
----

This is the Disposable Soft Synth Interface specification & example
code repository.

You'll find here:

  doc/RFC.txt -- proposed DSSI specification -- read this first

  dssi/dssi.h -- DSSI header file -- the comments define those parts
  of the spec dealing with host/plugin interaction (not covered in RFC)

  examples/dssi_osc_send.c
  examples/dssi_osc_update.c -- simple DSSI OSC test programs

  examples/dssi_example_host.c -- a basic example host implementation

  examples/trivial_synth.c -- a quite useless but fairly clear
  illustrative synth plugin

  examples/less_trivial_synth.c -- a synth that actually does some
  basic synthesis

  examples/less_trivial_synth_qt_gui.cpp -- a very simple Qt GUI
  for the above


Build
-----

To build the example code you will need:

  ALSA 0.9/1.0.x
  JACK
  LADSPA
  liblo-0.5 or above: http://www.plugin.org.uk/liblo/
  pkgconfig with PKG_CONFIG_PATH set appropriately to pick up liblo
  Qt 3 with QTDIR set appropriately

So long as PKG_CONFIG_PATH and QTDIR are set appropriately, a "make"
in the examples directory should build everything.


Test
----

Make sure JACK is running, cd to ./examples and run

  $ export DSSI_PATH=`pwd`
  $ ./dssi_example_host less_trivial_synth.so

A synth GUI should pop up, with an ALSA sequencer input and JACK
output (connected by default to the first alsa_pcm out).  If you
connect a MIDI keyboard (or vkeybd) to its ALSA MIDI input, you should
be able to play it and use MIDI controllers to adjust its parameters:
MIDI CC1 (the modulation wheel) controls timbre, and controllers 72,
73, 75 and 79 control release, attack, decay and sustain respectively
(some keyboards already have controls set up for these values).

What has actually happened (if it worked) is that the host process has
been started, has loaded the first synth plugin (labelled LTS) found
in the given .so file, has located the GUI executable that the make
procedure installed into examples/less_trivial_synth/LTS_qt,
instantiated the plugin, started the GUI and is now managing the MIDI
input from ALSA, control changes from the GUI and audio out to JACK.
